# Self-Hosted Panel
Host and manage ItsMyBot using your own instance of the Pterodactyl or Pelican panel.

### Why use a self-hosted panel?
Running your own panel like Pterodactyl gives you an intuitive interface for managing bots and apps while retaining server control.

## Requirements
- A server with Pterodactyl installed.
- Properly configured Pterodactyl (Wings, SSL, database, etc.).
- ItsMyBot is optimized for efficiency, using less than 200MB of RAM under normal conditions, but it is recommended to allocate 500MB to ensure smooth operation.

## Installation Steps
1. Before creating a server, you need to have a Node.js egg installed on your panel. If it's not already installed, follow the steps [below](#install-the-node-js-egg) to install it.
2. Go to your Admin panel of Pterodactyl, and navigate to **Servers**.
3. Click on **Create Server** and fill in the required fields:
   - **Name**: Choose a name for your bot.
   - **Server Owner**: Select the user who will own the server, usually yourself. You can type the email address of the user to find them.
   - **Memory**: Allocate at least 500MB of RAM for the bot to ensure smooth operation.
   - **Disk Space**: Allocate at least 4GB of disk space for the bot and its dependencies.
   - **Nest**: Select the nest you created earlier (e.g., `Generic`).
   - **Egg**: Select the Node.js egg you imported.
   - **Docker Image**: Ensure it is set to a version higher than Node.js 20.x
   - **Main File**: Ensure it is set to `build/index.js`.
4. Click on **Create Server** to create the server.
5. You can now go back to the user panel of Pterodactyl, select the server you just created and follow the [Hosting Provider](/installation/hosting-provider) guide to run the bot.

## Install the Node.js Egg
1. Download the Node.js egg from the [Pterodactyl Egg Repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelican-eggs/generic/refs/heads/main/nodejs/egg-pterodactyl-node-js-generic.json). You just need to righ-click on the page and select **Save as** to save the file.
2. Go to your Admin panel of Pterodactyl.
3. Navigate to **Nests** and click on **Create New**.
4. Put the name of the nest, for example `Generic`.
5. Click on **Save** and go back to the **Nests** page.
6. Click on the **Import Egg** button, select the file you downloaded, associate it with the nest you just created, and click on **Import**.
