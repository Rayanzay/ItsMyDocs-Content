# Addons

ItsMyBot has an addon system that allows you to extend the functionality of your bot.

## How to Install an Addon
To install an addon, you need to add the addon folder to the `build/addons` folder in the bot's directory. For most addons, it will automatically create its own configuration file in the `configs` folder.

## Addon Management
You can manage the addons by using the `addon` command. The command has the following subcommands:
### `addons list`
Lists all the addons that are currently installed and provides information about them.

### `addons enable <addon>`
Enables an addon.

### `addons disable <addon>`
Disables an addon.

## Update an Addon
To update an addon, you need to replace the addon folder in the `build/addons` folder with the new version of the addon.
