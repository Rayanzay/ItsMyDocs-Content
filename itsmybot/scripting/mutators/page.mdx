# Mutators
Mutators allow you to change the context of the actions. For example, you can change the member that the action is executed on, or the channel that the action is executed in. 

```yaml
actions:
  - id: sendMessage
    args:
      content: "%content%"
    triggers:
      - messageCreate
    mutators:
      channel: "logs" # Channel ID or name
```
Here, the mutator `channel` is used to change the channel of the action to the channel with ID `logs`. The action will be executed in the channel with ID `logs` instead of the channel where the trigger was fired.
