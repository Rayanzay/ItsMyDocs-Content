# Placeholder
ItsMyBot has a system similar to PlaceholderAPI, which you can find for a Minecraft server. ItsMyBot includes several internal extensions, and plugins also bring their own extensions!

You can use placeholders almost anywhere in the configuration. If a placeholder doesn’t work in a location where you’d like it to, don’t hesitate to contact support to have it added. The internal extensions are available in most messages that contain the necessary information!
