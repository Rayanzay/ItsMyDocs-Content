# How to configure Message
All messages from ItsMyBot can be configured with the following options, offering you even more possibilities. The messages support [placehalders](/itsmybot/configuration/placeholders/) in every property. You can use them to create dynamic messages that change based on the context.

```yaml {{ title: 'Example' }}
content: "Hello %user_mention% !"
embeds:
  - title: "%mcstatus_example_players% Players"
    description: "Server is %mcstatus_example_status% !"
    color: "#ff0000"
components:
  "1":
    - type: "button"
      label: "First Button"
      style: "primary"
      custom-id: "button1"
    - type: "button"
      label: "Second Button"
      style: "link"
      url: "https://example.com"
      emoji: "ðŸ”—"
